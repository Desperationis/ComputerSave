Here are the instructions to enter compute mode:

Enter root by typing 'su'

Go to /sys/bus/pci/drivers/amdgpu and find your device (usually 0000:something)

There, change power_dpm_force_performance_level from "auto" to "manual" by using echo "manual" > power_dpm_force_performance_level. This allows us to manually change to compute mode

Then, write "5" to pp_power_profile_mode through echo 5 > pp_power_profile_mode; This is the ONLY way to do this, you cannot use vim. You can cat the file out to see the options.

Profit

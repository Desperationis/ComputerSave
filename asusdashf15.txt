Hello future me! These are the (painful) steps I took to reach an ubuntu 20.04 system that would boot. I did succeed, and actually managed to not only start up the Nvidia 3070 on boot to use for the xorg server, I am able to switch between dedicated graphics and integrated graphics freely. Cool huh?

Before trying anything, I tried to install Ubuntu, as is, without doing anything. I installed the third-party drivers during installation. On the first boot, the system was super glitchy. It still worked, and it did run using the 3070, but it never booted again and resulting in a black screen.

This then led me to https://www.reddit.com/r/Asustuf/comments/li6vfj/anyone_is_dual_booting_windows_and_ubuntu/, a fellow user of the same brand. While their advice was non applicable to me, it did say this: "But keep in mind, Nouveau drivers suck for this laptop". I uninstalled the "xserver-xorg-video-nouveau" package using a chrooted Arch LiveCD (make sure that xserver-xorg-video-nvidia and xserver-org-video-intel are installed) and the system booted perfectly. 

However, like my Arch Installation, the system only used intel graphics, as seen by using glxinfo | grep "renderer". I fiddled around a bit and found that going into "Additional Drivers" in the Ubuntu settings and changing the graphic drivers from Nouveau to one of the Nvidia properitary drivers enabled me to dynamically change between the different graphics by going into the Nvidia Settings DASH app; Keep in mind that the Nvidia app did not work at all on the open source drivers. 

And, that's it! With that, you should have a fully, 100% no issue Ubuntu installation.
